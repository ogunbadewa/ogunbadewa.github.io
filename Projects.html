<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
<dl>
    <dt>Diode-Based Logic Gates</dt>
    <dd>The Debounced Switch SR Latch project was a dynamic exploration of digital electronics, addressing the critical issue of switch bounce. 
        Switch bounce occurs when a mechanical switch rapidly makes and breaks contact during transition, leading to multiple unwanted state changes and erratic behavior. 
        To solve this problem, I integrated a debouncing circuit, which included diodes, resistors, and capacitors, with a classic SR Latch. The SR Latch, a bistable circuit,  effectively captured and stored binary data without being affected by the erratic switch transitions.

    <dt>Duke 250/16 Architecture Design and Implementation</dt>
    <dd>I designed a 16-bit MIPS-like RISC architecture, the Duke 250/16, with an insturction set encompassing functions like add, jr, jal, xor, bgt and sll. Using Logisim, I meticulously created and tested a digital CPU circuit that implemented the instruction set architecture.</dd>

    <dt>Music Synthesis</dt>
    <dd>I explored the fundamentals of music generation using MATLAB. By manipulating properties such as amplitude, phase, and frequency of these sinusoids, I was able to generate various musical effects like echo, reverb, timbre, culminating in the creation of a captivating and soothing melody. </dd>

    <dt>AM Signal</dt>
    <dd>I used function generators to create a carrier signal which was then modulated with the information signal(a music audio from my laptop) to create an AM signal. This AM signal is then processed with a Low-Pass filter to improve the signal quality. using diode, Resistors, and capactiors, I crafted an envelope detector circuit to demodulate the AM signal. This endeavor culminated in the successful broadcast of a podcast across my room </dd>

    <dt>MIPS assembly</dt>
    <dd>Wrote a C program that read the stats of 3000 soccer teams, calculated a metric based on these statistics, and ranked these teams. The analysis achieved an impressive 71% accuracy in predicting game winners of various Premier League games. Manually translated and compiled the C program's source code into MIPS assembly language. </dd>

    <dt> HackDuke</dt>
    <dd>Collaborated with a three-member team to design a website catering to individuals with ADHD to document their daily activies as part of duke's annual hackaton. I was tasked with exploring the intersection of ADHD with colors, shape, and visual to inform the website design. I also led the revamp of the website using CSS to enhance navigation and improve overall user experience</dd>

    <dt>Integrated Design Challenge</dt>
    <dd>Member of a team of three tasked with desinging a robot that detects material in a given area and realsy results to other robots. I headed the communication section where i wired XBEE and wrote aruino codes to interact with the QTI sensors and also communicate with other robots.  </dd>
